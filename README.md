![Dry grass bundle](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3e0da463-e27b-4385-a38c-e70543125f1c)

Adds a new item, Dry grass bundle.

Expanded crafting recipes to include all (most?) cattail top recipes to be craftable using dry grass bundles.

Dry grass bundles are 1:1 with cattails, but cost 2 dry grass to craft the bundle, to make it feel less cheaty.

 

Also adds dry grass versions of Reed chest and Hand basket

 


>Version 1.0.0 is purely for a recipe of turning dry grass into ropes.
