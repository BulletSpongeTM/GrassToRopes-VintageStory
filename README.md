![Dry grass bundle](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3e0da463-e27b-4385-a38c-e70543125f1c)

Adds a new item, Dry grass bundle.

Expanded crafting recipes to include all (most?) cattail top recipes to be craftable using dry grass bundles.

Dry grass bundles are 1:1 with cattails, but cost 2 dry grass to craft the bundle, to make it feel less cheaty.

 

Currently it's possible to create baskets from dry grass bundles, then deconstruct them for cattailtops. I'd probably have to make custom versions of each basket to cicumvent that, which isn't really on my to do list. I don't find it to be much of a problem anyway. You can turn the cattailtops back into the equal amount of grass using a knife.

 


Previous version (v1.0.0) is purely grass to ropes only
